# C-Learning-Process
 These are the files that I made while learning C.

Why did I start learning C?

I started learning it because I thought it would be helpfull and fun to learn about the language that shaped Unix and the Linux
kernel. So I started looking for some tutorials and found one from a Youtuber called Caleb Curry, I liked this tutorial of his
because the video's where short and easy to understand. After watching some video's I started to understand the language and
began to really liking it. So here it is, my way of understanding C and there are going to be many more apps that I will be
creating.

Disclaimer

Some of the code is in Dutch my native language. Not all but some of it is. So heads up to that.
